Detect an object using the HAAR descriptors 

This project is for the CS 510 Intro to Visual Computing at Portland State University. 
# Task 

Train an image detection model to pick out the object it has been trained on given an image. This program uses HAAR descriptors to train the model. 
OpenCV provides built in detectors for a few popular categories like people. It'd be really cool to train the computer to recognize custom objects.
